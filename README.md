### Blackjack Game ðŸŽ´

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Blackjack card game, written in Python. The game allows you to play against a computer dealer, simulating the experience of a real Blackjack game.

#### Features:

- **Randomized Deck**: Cards are drawn at random, simulating a real deck.
- **Ace Handling**: Aces can count as either 1 or 11, depending on the player's hand.
- **Score Calculation**: Automatic score calculation with special handling for Blackjack (21 with two cards).
- **User Interaction**: The game prompts the player to either draw another card or pass.
- **Computer Dealer**: The dealer draws cards according to Blackjack rules, ensuring a fair challenge.
- **Multiple Rounds**: The game can be replayed multiple times in a single session.

#### How to Play:

- Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Decide whether to draw another card or pass based on your current score.
- Try to beat the dealer without going over 21!

This project is a great way to practice Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditionals while having some fun with a classic game.
